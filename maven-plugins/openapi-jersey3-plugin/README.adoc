== changes
* 8.7 - fixes two issues:
** Make handling of multi-part file uploads more consistent between service, client and impl layers
** Fix nested enum semicolon placement issue
* 8.6 - update to the equals so that it uses a deepEquals for arrays
* 8.5 - extended the common support library, you must use `cd.connect.openapi.gensupport:openapi-jersey3-support:2.5` or later with this release as it includes new annotations.
* 8.4 - support for CloudEvents annotations `x-cloudevent-type` and `x-cloudevent-subject` generates static strings
in the model class holding that data.
* 8.3 - support for formal declared headers in clients
* 8.2 - support nullable: true as a field on a non-required field to allow it to be specifically null (usually lists and maps where they were always default empty)
* 8.1 - move to 6.0.1 of the OpenAPI plugin standard, and default to allow enums to be null.
* 7.15 - fixing issue with ReturnStatus code if returning no data and you want a 200 return. Added in support
for additional property 'prometheus' to support the `@Prometheus` annotation from the `prometheus-jersey-filter` 4.1+
if `prometheus=true` is set in your additional properties list.

* 7.11: Adds support for javax imports instead of jakarta ones as the jersey2 plugin is now very far behind
in terms of capability. Specifying an additional property of `jersey2` will make it generate `javax` prefixes
instead of `jakarta` ones.
* 7.10: Cleans up support for cross package export of source, `x-package` now works reliably
* 7.9: Support for where the delegate holder is in a different package. Sorting out Guava 26 issue.
* 7.8: Fixes to the x-package support (a model with x-package can change the actual package it gets deployed into
supporting merging common models in and placing them in common locations). Support for Kotlin Nullable and Non-Nullable
annotations.
* 7.7: Clean up an issue with enums, and support `x-package` in a class which allows you to override the package
that a specific class is actually in. This leads to better composition where all classes do not have to be in  the same package
and you can share snippets of yaml.
* 7.6: Delegators annotated with @Singleton and support for enums that match the OpenAPI doc exactly, previously
they had to be upper case or they would not match.
* 7.5: allowing overrides of individual properties by using x-basename
* 7.4: fixing headers for etags and allowing non-200 responses
* 7.1: move to Jakarta APIs
* 6.5: support UUIDs properly
* 6.2: introduces the ReturnStatus when the function returns a 2xx response that isn't 200. Jersey when
returning a class will always return 200, even if your API says 201 or 204. You need to upgrade to the 1.4
release of `openapi-jersey2-support` or later where the `ReturnStatusContainerResponseFilter` exists and
register it with your jersey context to ensure this status is set on return. You need to add this to your
own implementations unless you are using server-delegate in which case it is added automatically.
* 6.1: swap to version 5.x of the OpenAPI generator.
* 6.1: allow you to skip generating the "copy" method by using an x-no-copy
* 6.1: fix the issue with produces and consumes using Lists instead of proper lists with "hasMore"

== changes in 5.1

This makes a major change to the way that grouping of APIs are done and honours the standard adopted in other
languages of using the `tags` field of each API endpoint. If you don't have these, it will continue to use the 4.x
functionality of using the basePath.

This is a breaking change for those using the server-security model as those are now named after the tags.

The is a new supported model called `server-delegate` which will allow you support optional fields in an object.
This means that the normal Security interface is created, but a delegate instance of for that is created, along
with a holder class for the optional parameters, and another interface which is called.

If we take this sample from the integration test layer. The interesting part of the spec:

[source, yaml]
----
paths:
  "/mr-api/authentication/{id}/replaceTempPassword":
    parameters:
      - name: id
        description: "The id of the person to replace temporary password for"
        in: path
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
      - name: includeGroups
        description: "Include groups for this this portfolio in results"
        in: query
        schema:
          type: boolean
      - name: includeApplications
        description: "Include applications for this portfolio in results"
        in: query
        schema:
          type: boolean
    put:
      tags:
        - AuthService
      description: "Replace temporary password"
      x-java-annotations: "@io.featurehub.mr.api.AllowedDuringPasswordReset"
      security:
        - bearerAuth: []
      operationId: replaceTempPassword
----

Notice the additional support for annotations on the operation. This text is placed as is in the code.

This will generate the standard security interface (as it has a security annotation). Note the class
is called `AuthService` - as per the tag.

[source, java]
----
@Path("/mr-api")
public interface AuthService {

  /**
   [javadoc removed]
   */
  @PUT
  @Path("/authentication/{id}/replaceTempPassword")
  @Consumes({"application/json"})
  @Produces({"application/json"})
  @io.featurehub.mr.api.AllowedDuringPasswordReset
  public TokenizedPerson replaceTempPassword(
      @PathParam("id") String id,
      @NotNull @Valid PasswordReset passwordReset,
      @QueryParam("includeGroups") Boolean includeGroups,
      @QueryParam("includeApplications") Boolean includeApplications,
      @Context SecurityContext securityContext);
}
----

It will also generate two more classes.

[source,java]
----
public class AuthServiceDelegator implements AuthService {
  private final AuthServiceDelegate delegate;

  @Inject
  public AuthServiceDelegator(AuthServiceDelegate delegate) {
    this.delegate = delegate;
  }

  /** Replace temporary password */
  @io.featurehub.mr.api.AllowedDuringPasswordReset
  public TokenizedPerson replaceTempPassword(
      String id,
      PasswordReset passwordReset,
      Boolean includeGroups,
      Boolean includeApplications,
      SecurityContext securityContext) {
    final AuthServiceDelegate.ReplaceTempPasswordHolder holder =
        new AuthServiceDelegate.ReplaceTempPasswordHolder();
    holder.includeGroups = includeGroups;
    holder.includeApplications = includeApplications;
    return delegate.replaceTempPassword(id, passwordReset, holder, securityContext);
  }
}
----

the AuthServiceDelegator you need to `bind` in Jersey-land. So you will `.register(AuthService.class)` and
then in your code you will need to bind this one - we recommend as a singleton as that will make it perform
the best.

The annotation is repeated in case you have interceptors, the method they get is this method so if
you are looking for the annotation, you need it.

The base interface you will need to implement is as follows (and is generated):

[source,java]
----
public interface AuthServiceDelegate {

  static class ReplaceTempPasswordHolder {
    public Boolean includeGroups;
    public Boolean includeApplications;
  }

  /**
   * Replace temporary password
   *
   * @see AuthService#replaceTempPassword
   */
  public TokenizedPerson replaceTempPassword(
      String id,
      PasswordReset passwordReset,
      ReplaceTempPasswordHolder holder,
      SecurityContext securityContext);
}
----

Also as Swagger was replaced by OpenAPI 3 in 2017, we have now dropped all support for those annotations.



== changes from v2.x (in v4.x)

We have swapped to the `org.openapitools` project instead of the current Swagger one, and it has
a raft of changes over the 3.x version. We are now also generating three different API sets in one codebase,
and you need to chose which ones you generate or you will get no APIs, only models.

----
<additionalProperties>
  <additionalProperty>server-security</additionalProperty>
</additionalProperties>
----

You can chose from `client`, `server` and `server-security`. `client` generates client only APIs, but it does
rely on `server` as that is a plain interface. You can generate `server` by itself. You can generate `server-security`
by itself or all three. `server-security` is like `server` but you have an `@Context SecurityContext securityContext` at
the end of the line.

You can also use bean validation:

----
<configOptions>
  <configOption>
    <name>useBeanValidation</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </configOption>
</configOptions>
----

Which will enforce bean validation, but you do need to add a useful ConstraintExceptionHandler yourself.

e.g.

----
import cd.connect.jackson.JacksonObjectProvider;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolation;
import jakarta.validation.ConstraintViolationException;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response;
import jakarta.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class ConstraintExceptionHandler implements ExceptionMapper<ConstraintViolationException> {
  private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ConstraintExceptionHandler.class);

  @Override
  public Response toResponse(ConstraintViolationException exception) {
    return Response.status(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST)
      .entity(prepareMessage(exception))
      .type("application/json")
      .build();
  }

  private String prepareMessage(ConstraintViolationException exception) {
    Map<String, String> fields = new HashMap<>();
    for (ConstraintViolation<?> cv : exception.getConstraintViolations()) {
      fields.put(cv.getPropertyPath().toString(), cv.getMessage());
    }

    try {
      return JacksonObjectProvider.mapper.writeValueAsString(fields);
    } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
      log.error("totally failed", e);
      return "{}";
    }
  }
}
----

=== Maven
A full plugin declaration would look similar to this:

----
<plugin>
<groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
<artifactId>openapi-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>4.0.0</version>
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>cd.connect.openapi</groupId>
    <artifactId>connect-openapi-jersey2</artifactId>
    <version>4.4</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
<executions>
  <execution>
    <id>featurehub-api</id>
    <goals>
      <goal>generate</goal>
    </goals>
    <phase>generate-sources</phase>
    <configuration>
      <output>${project.basedir}/target/generated-sources/api</output>
      <apiPackage>your.api</apiPackage>
      <modelPackage>your.model</modelPackage>
      <inputSpec>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/your-api.yaml</inputSpec>
      <language>jersey2-api</language>
      <library>jersey2-api</library>
      <additionalProperties>
        <additionalProperty>server-security</additionalProperty>
      </additionalProperties>
      <configOptions>
        <configOption>
          <name>useBeanValidation</name>
          <value>true</value>
        </configOption>
      </configOptions>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
----

=== Gradle

In Gradle, you have to make this extra library available to the buildscript, so at the top of your file before
your plugin declaration you need a section similar to:

----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenLocal()
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath "cd.connect.openapi:connect-openapi-jersey2:5.4"
	}
}
----

from there in your openApiGenerator definitions, you specify the server format in additional properties:

----
openApiGenerate {
    generatorName = "jersey2-api"
    inputSpec = openApiSpec
    outputDir = openApiOutputDir
    apiPackage = "com.your-company.api"
    modelPackage = "com.your-company.api.model"
	  additionalProperties = [
	    'server-delegate': 'server-delegate'
	  ]
    configOptions = [:]
}
----

== changes from v1.x

The 2.x line adds support for openapi v3 using the openapi v3 plugin and
extensions for Jersey 2.26+.

It differs from the standard by using common support files, separating the
implementation and interface - so the interface is a standard Jersey
annotated interface that can be easily used in tests or used in dynamic
generated proxy if desired. Thus it provides a bridge between old and new.

It expects you will also use the library as support files.
